# CS2400Homework5
Andrew Vu, Nathan Pham
We used a an adjacency list implementation of a graph in our code, which uses linked lists to represent vertices and edges in a graph.
The GraphDriver file creates the example graph by adding edges to connect vertices. Running this file outputs the Breadth first and Depth first traversals of the graph.
